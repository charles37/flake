# flake
My Personal NixOS config flake

Just switched to Hyprland

Optimized for Haskell/Elm/Purescript/Rust development

The Neovim cofiguration is an adaptation of thePrimagen's neovim config but fully nixified plugin management using nixVim

Meant to run on my Thinkpad, which doesn't have the best hardware
